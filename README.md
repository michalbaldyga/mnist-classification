# Deep Neural Network for MNIST Classification

The aim of this project was to gain a basic understanding of the TensorFlow 2.

## Problem description
The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image). The goal is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes.
